# Azure Sentinel Lab: Mapping Failed RDP Logins

## Introduction
In this lab, we will set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. We will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.

## Prerequisites

The Powershell script in this repository is responsible for parsing out Windows Event Log information for failed RDP attacks and using a third party API [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/) to collect geographic information about the attackers location. You will `sign up` at ipgeolocation to get your `own` API key to load into the PowerShell script.

    This function creates a bunch of sample log files that will be used to train the
    Extract feature in Log Analytics workspace. If you don't have enough log files to
    "train" it, it will fail to extract certain fields for some reason -_-.
    We can avoid including these fake records on our map by filtering out all logs with
    a destination host of "samplehost"

 ## Configure VM and Deploy Resources
  
</summary
We will create a Virtual Machine that will be exposed to the internet where people around world will be able to attack it. Bad actors will try to login to this Virtual Machine once they've discovered that it's now online. While creating the Virtual Machine, we will create a new Resource Group as well.
 
We will create a Virtual Machine that will be exposed to the internet where people around world will be able to attack it. 
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h3R75Bp.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Create Virtual Machine"/></p>
To make it susceptive to attacks, we will adjust the inbound rules as follows:
 <pre>
 <b>Source </b>
 any
 <b>Source port ranges </b> 
 * 
 <b>Destination </b>
 any 
 <b>Service </b>
 custom
 <b>Destination port ranges </b>
 *
 <b>Protocol</b>
 any
 <b>Priority</b>
 100</pre>

Bad actors will try to login to this Virtual Machine once they've discovered that it's now online. While creating the Virtual Machine, we will create a new Resource Group as well.

## Create Our Log Ananlytics Workspace and Enable Defender
  
 </summary>  
Now, we are going to create our Log Analytics Workspace to receive or ingest logs from the virtual machine such as windows event logs and our custom logs that has geographic information in order to discover where the attackers are located. Our SIEM will be able to connect to the workspace to be able to display the geo-data on the map that will be created later in the lab. 
 
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XOUSezh.png" height="90%" width="90%" alt="Create Log Analytics Workspace"/></p>
 
We will set up Microsoft Defender now to enable the ability to gather logs from the Virtual Machine.

We will toggle the Defender plan: Server to 'ON' and the Data Collection of Windows Security events to 'All Events'

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yi6id7d.png" height="90%" width="90%" alt="Defender for Cloud"/></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/udhv65g.png" height="90%" width="90%" alt="Defender for Cloud"/></p>
 
We can now go back to our log analytics workspace to connect our Virtual Machine.

## Disable Firewall and Run Powershell Code
 
 </summary> 
Now we will log into our Virtual Machine using Remote Desktop 
 
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LxuSrwJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="RDP"/></p>

By going to Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security, we can see the security logs of our VM. Specifically, we can observe failed login attempts of the attackers.
 
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oerjh7t.png" height="90%" width="90%" alt="Event Viewer"/></p>

Now we will disable all Firewall settings on our VM (Domain Profile, Private Profile and Public Profile) to make it appear more vulnerable to attackers.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/enyGgif.png" height="90%" width="90%" alt="Windows Firewall"/></p>

To get the geodata of the attackers, we will run the Powershell script I have pasted above. Before we do that, we have to retrieve our unique IP API key to insert into the code for it to run successfully. This can be done on https://ipgeolocation.io/

<p align="center"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fbKjYck.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="IP Geo"/></p>

Your API key will replace where it says $API_KEY in the code (highlighted)
Now we will run the code on Powershell to retrieve the geodata of the attackers.

## Create a Custom Log and Utilize KQL
  
 </summary> 
The next thing that we'll do is create a custom log. We will go to the Log Analytics Workspace, create a custom log with the following file which can be retrieved from the virtual machine with the path >  C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log

<p align="center"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7fUFmvS.png" height="110%" width="110%" alt="custom log"/></p>
Since the custom log has been established, we can go to Logs and enter "FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL" in the Kusto Query Language (KQL) field and see logs of all the failed log in attempts.

<p align="center"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xAORM8K.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="KQL"/></p>

 </details>

 <details> 
 <summary> 
  
## Create Workbook for World Map Visualization
  
 </summary> 
Now we will go to Microsoft Sentinel and create a new Workbook. 

We will run the following query that reflects the key points we require from our logs: latitude, longitude, sourcehost, label, destination, country.
<pre>
FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL 
| extend username = extract(@"username:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         timestamp = extract(@"timestamp:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         latitude = extract(@"latitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         longitude = extract(@"longitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         sourcehost = extract(@"sourcehost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         state = extract(@"state:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         label = extract(@"label:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         destination = extract(@"destinationhost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
         country = extract(@"country:([^,]+)", 1, RawData)
| where destination != "samplehost"
| where sourcehost != ""
| summarize event_count=count() by latitude, longitude, sourcehost, label, destination, country
</pre>

We set the Visualization type to Map, creating a graphic of our attackers from all over the world.
